				FSML In His Grace
			</h1>

			<p>
				FSML is a postfix concatenative homoiconic programming language designed to give me and everyone
				for those who wish a familiar, comfortable postfix programming environment and be competitive in
				modern realities, effective in every way.

			<p>
				The development is in its infancy, so most of the document will be devoted to language concepts
				and its development plans, not what has already been done. Although for the seed , I will first
				show a few small examples of what has already been done. Then I will describe the concept. And at
				the end I will give you the technical details. I hope that the reader is generally familiar with
				postfix programming languages, such as Forth, Factor or 8th.
			</p>

			<p>
				First of all, note that objects duplicated using typical Forth words like dup, over, etc are
				available by reference, not by value. In particular, this means the following.
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					1 dup
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] 1 -> 1
				</p>
				<p>
					25 +
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] 1 + 25 -> 1 + 25
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Oops! This is not what you would expect from a Forth or a Factor. In these languages, the result
				would be:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					1 dup
				</p>
				<p>
					stack: 1 -> 1
				</p>
				<p>
					25 +
				</p>
				<p>
					stack: 26 -> 1
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				This is explained by the fact that in FSML, by duplicating a stack element using DUP, we actually
				duplicated a reference to an object, since an abstract stack can actually contain only references.
				Thus, both resulting stack elements are references to the same object. And by adding 25 to it, we
				made this object an expression of 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Therefore, the top two elements of the stack
				refer to this expression.
			</p>

			<p>
				Need "ind" after "dup" to detach. "ind" means independent or individual, at your choice. It
				creates a new object and rearranges the reference to it. This new object still references the same
				subexpression as before. But all subsequent operations on it will create a different semantic
				graph. From now on, they will have a different history of operations on them, imprinted in the
				nodes of abstract semantic graphs (asg). But what was done before "ind" will remain a common part
				of the history of operations on the element.
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					1 dup ind
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] 1 -> 1
				</p>
				<p>
					25 +
				</p>
				<p>
					[2] 1 + 25 -> 1
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				There is also a "dc" operation, which means deep copy. dc performs a deep copy of the asg
				corresponding to the stack element. From this moment on, a completely new graph appears, which has
				no vertices in common with the original one. The new graph is not an exact copy of the original
				one. For example, the vertices of a graph may contain uids, which by definition cannot be the same
				as in the prototype.
			</p>

				1. Calculate the factorial of a number &nbsp;12 using if и while&nbsp;:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					12 dup [ 1 [ over * over 1 - ] while swap dp ] [ 0 ] if .eval
				</p>
				<p>
					\ [479001600]
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				2. Fetch and hold the value of variable in the good old touching Forth-style using @ и&nbsp;!&nbsp;:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					123 some_name !
					<br> some_name @ 456 +
					<br> .eval dp
				</p>
				<p>
					\ [ 579 ]
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				3. Strings&nbsp;:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					'We put a string with spaces on the stack and immediately drop it using dp' dp
				<div></div>
				<br> 'dp is a short alias for the classic drop' dp
				<div></div>
				<br> 'Without indentation between the left quotation mark and the beginning of the line, this is
				not necessary here' dp
				<div></div>
				<br> "Or with double quotes" dp
				<div></div>
				<br> Or_without_quotes_at_all_if_the_string_does_not_contain_whitespace_characters dp
				<div></div>
				<br> '\ Full-fledged comments have not yet been implemented, so for now it is also for comments,
				although the string start can be from the backslash of the Forth comment, so that it is
				clear, but still it is only a string' dp
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				4. Gluing the lines together in a loop&nbsp;:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					"" comma !
					<br> 2 "" [ comma @ + ' somename_' + over + '_alias = somename_'
					<br> + over + ', ' comma ! over 1 - ] while swap dp
					<br> 'let ' swap + ';' +
					<br> .eval dp
				</p>
				<p>
					\ [let somename_2_alias = somename_2, somename_1_alias = somename_1;]
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				5. Create an empty array and put a couple of elements&nbsp;:
			</p>

			<div class="source-code">
				<p>
					list 12 push 34 push
					<br> .js
				</p>
				<p>
					\ var subex_2 = [];
					<br> \ var subex_1 = (subex_2 .push (12), subex_2);
					<br> \ var subex_0 = (subex_1 .push (34), subex_1);
				</p>
			</div>
